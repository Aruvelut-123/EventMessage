# EventMessage
A Velocity plugin that adds global announcement functionality, sending specific custom messages when players join or leave the network or subserver.  
Message formatting fully supports the [MiniMessage](https://docs.papermc.io/adventure/minimessage/format/) syntax, but doesn't support vanilla one for now.  
  
A configuration example will be added to here soon, as the current version's relevant config reference is not yet complete.  
  
Also after the first stable release it will become GPL license and open source on github :)
